#Credit risk analysis report

An overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to identify how well we can predict whether borrowers have either healthy credit profiles, or high-risk credit profiles.
The results:
        accuracy score - the accuracy score of 99% is so high due to the fact that the model is able to correctly predict results of the larger subset of the data (healthy loans)
        precision score - the model was able to more accurately classify healthy loans as healthy than it was at classifying high-risk loans as high-risk        
        recall score - again, the model was able to more accurately classify healthy loans as healthy than it was at classifying high-risk loans as high-risk
Summary:
    The model is much better at predicting healthy loans than it is at predicting high-risk loans. I would recommend the model for assisting in making decsions regarding credit profiles. I wouldn't recommend that it be the only tool used in the evaluation given that it's less than 90% accurate at correctly predicting high-risk loans. Buying a home is the largest purhcase that most people will make in their liftime, so it's important that these decisions are correct. The lower precision and recall scores also help to support that recommendation.
