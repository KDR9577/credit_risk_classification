# credit_risk_classification
Structure your report by using the report template that Starter_Code.zip includes, ensuring that it contains the following:

Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.
Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
Generate a confusion matrix.
Generate a classification report.
Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
